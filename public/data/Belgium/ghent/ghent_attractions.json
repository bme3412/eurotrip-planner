This masterpiece of Flemish primitive art is considered one of the most important works in European art history. The cathedral itself dates back to the 10th century, though the current Gothic structure was largely built in the 14th-16th centuries. The interior features an impressive 89-meter nave, remarkable stone vaulting, and numerous artistic treasures beyond the Altarpiece, including Rubens' 'The Conversion of St. Bavo' and the rococo pulpit by Laurent Delvaux. The cathedral's 78-meter tower dominates Ghent's skyline and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed belfries of Belgium. The crypt contains wall paintings dating from the 12th century and the tombs of several Ghent bishops.",

This well-preserved stone castle with its distinctive turrets and moat was modeled after the Crusader castles the count had seen in Syria. Throughout its history, the castle served as the seat of the Counts of Flanders, a courthouse, a prison, and even a factory before being restored to its medieval appearance in the late 19th century. Today, visitors can explore the castle's ramparts, keep, stables, and torture chamber, which houses a collection of guillotines and medieval torture devices. The panoramic views from the battlements offer sweeping vistas of Ghent's historical center.

Beyond functioning as a public library with over 225,000 books, De Krook serves as a multidisciplinary knowledge center housing university research departments, digital innovation labs, and creative industry workspaces. The interior features adaptable reading rooms with panoramic city views, interactive media installations, event spaces, exhibition areas, and a café. The building's name references both its riverside location (historically called 'De Krook') and the Dutch word 'krook' meaning 'fold,' reflecting the structure's angular design.

Notable features include the baroque Church of St. Elisabeth (1663-1666), the impressive entrance gate, and the bridge spanning the Lieve canal. Unlike other Belgian beguinages that now function as museums, Ghent's Grand Beguinage maintains its residential character as a university housing complex, creating an intriguing blend of historical preservation and contemporary academic life.

The undulating landscape featuring mature specimen trees, ornamental water features, and winding paths exemplifies 19th-century romantic garden design principles. The park gains cultural significance from its association with the 1913 World's Fair, for which several structures were built, including the Palace of Flowers (now SMAK contemporary art museum) and the Palace of Fine Arts (now MSK museum). Notable sculptural elements throughout the park include works by Belgian artists Georges Minne and Domien Ingels, while original iron bandstands and stone bridges contribute to the historic character.

Appropriately for its original function, the structure features numerous decorative elements inspired by marine themes, including Neptune sculptures, fish motifs, and water symbolism. Throughout its operational history until 1952, the marketplace served as the central distribution point for fish arriving from the North Sea coast, playing a vital role in Ghent's food supply system. After years of neglect following its closure as a market, the building underwent comprehensive restoration in the early 2000s, now housing restaurants and event spaces while maintaining its architectural integrity. The structure occupies a strategic position at the confluence of two canals, creating one of Ghent's most photogenic views where water, historic architecture, and urban activity converge.

            "description": "The House of Alijn (Huis van Alijn) offers a unique exploration of everyday life in 20th-century Belgium, housed in a former children's hospice dating from the 16th century. Originally founded as the Hospice of the Children of Alijn by wealthy cloth merchant Willem Alijns in 1363, the current buildings primarily date from the 17th century and feature traditional Flemish architectural elements arranged around a peaceful courtyard. Since its transformation into a museum in 1962, the institution has focused on documenting, preserving, and interpreting the cultural heritage of daily life, celebrating ordinary experiences rather than exceptional achievements. The permanent exhibition presents reconstructed historical interiors, extensive collections of domestic objects, and rich multimedia archives of home movies, photographs, and sound recordings that chronicle how Belgian family life, celebrations, and routines evolved throughout the 20th century. Thematic displays explore topics such as birth, death, holidays, leisure activities, and domestic rituals across different social classes. The museum excels at creating immersive, nostalgic environments that resonate with visitors' personal memories while placing individual experiences within broader social historical contexts. A particular strength lies in its audiovisual collection, which preserves amateur recordings of family occasions that collectively document changing social customs, fashion, and domestic environments across generations.",

            "description": "Sint-Baafsplein (St. Bavo's Square) functions as Ghent's primary urban space, a grand plaza that showcases the city's historical evolution through the monumental buildings that frame it. Dominated by the imposing Gothic facade of St. Bavo's Cathedral on its eastern side, the square also features the Renaissance-style Cloth Hall and the neoclassical Royal Dutch Theatre, creating an architectural ensemble that spans five centuries of design history. The square's current appearance largely results from 19th-century urban planning that cleared medieval structures to create a formal civic space, though its origins as a gathering place date to the Middle Ages. Beyond its architectural significance, Sint-Baafsplein serves as Ghent's ceremonial center, hosting official events, cultural celebrations, and the primary stage for the annual Ghent Festival. The square functions as a crucial orientation point for visitors, marking the transition between the commercial shopping districts and the historic medieval core. Renovated in 2012 with contemporary paving and urban furniture, the space balances historical context with modern urban design needs. The absence of traffic creates a pedestrian-friendly environment that encourages public gathering, street performances, and café culture, making it both a tourist attraction and authentic community space for residents.",
