This imposing Gothic structure with its distinctive wooden truss ceiling was designed specifically for meat trade, with open sides for ventilation and display. The building's construction represented the butchers' guild's prominent position in medieval society and their power to obtain prime real estate near the city center. After centuries of continuous use as a meat market, followed by various repurposing, the hall underwent comprehensive restoration in the 1990s and now serves as a center for the promotion of East Flemish regional products. Visitors can admire the impressive oak roof beams spanning the hall's length, original stone elements, and architectural details while sampling local culinary specialties.

The park's creation marked a significant transition from military to civilian use, transforming defensive fortifications into public recreation space during a period of urban expansion. The undulating landscape featuring mature specimen trees, ornamental water features, and winding paths exemplifies 19th-century romantic garden design principles. The park gains cultural significance from its association with the 1913 World's Fair, for which several structures were built, including the Palace of Flowers (now SMAK contemporary art museum) and the Palace of Fine Arts (now MSK museum). Notable sculptural elements throughout the park include works by Belgian artists Georges Minne and Domien Ingels, while original iron bandstands and stone bridges contribute to the historic character.

Construction began in the early 15th century, replacing an earlier Romanesque church, but financial constraints prevented the tower from reaching its planned 134-meter height, leaving it truncated at 24 meters and earning it the affectionate local nickname 'stump tower.' Despite this unfinished element, the church showcases exceptional late Gothic architecture with elegant flying buttresses, an impressive central nave rising to 27 meters, and remarkable stained glass windows. The interior houses significant artistic treasures including Anthony Van Dyck's 'Crucifixion' altarpiece (1629), impressive baroque confessionals, and an ornate pulpit by Laurent Delvaux. The church occupies a strategic position at the foot of Saint Michael's Bridge, which offers one of Ghent's most iconic views encompassing the church alongside the medieval skyline featuring the Three Towers of Ghent.

The elegant complex consists of two symmetrical pavilions connected by a central triumphal arch, all executed in a refined late 18th-century style with Doric columns, decorative friezes, and classical proportions that reflect the Enlightenment's preference for rational, harmonious design. Appropriately for its original function, the structure features numerous decorative elements inspired by marine themes, including Neptune sculptures, fish motifs, and water symbolism. Throughout its operational history until 1952, the marketplace served as the central distribution point for fish arriving from the North Sea coast, playing a vital role in Ghent's food supply system. After years of neglect following its closure as a market, the building underwent comprehensive restoration in the early 2000s, now housing restaurants and event spaces while maintaining its architectural integrity.
