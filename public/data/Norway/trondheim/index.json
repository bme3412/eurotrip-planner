Many restaurants and attractions close early on Christmas Eve and may remain closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 26). Public transportation runs on limited schedules.

Winter activities like cross-country skiing in Bymarka and ice skating at outdoor rinks are popular, and museums welcome visitors seeking indoor activities during the cold weather.
