Many restaurants and attractions close early on Christmas Eve and may remain closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 26). Public transportation runs on limited schedules. Despite this, winter tourism begins to increase as international visitors arrive for holiday celebrations."

Winter activities like cross-country skiing in Kauppi Sports Park and ice skating at outdoor rinks are popular, and museums welcome visitors seeking indoor activities during the cold weather. Many restaurants and shops reopen after brief Christmas closures. This can be a good time to visit for those seeking a quieter experience of the city while still enjoying the holiday atmosphere."
