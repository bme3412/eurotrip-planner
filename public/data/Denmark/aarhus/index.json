The facility's architectural design features angular wooden platforms and decking that rise organically from the water, offering spaces for swimming, sunbathing, diving, and social gathering within sight of the city center. Unlike traditional swimming pools, the Harbor Bath uses the natural, filtered seawater of Aarhus Bay, connecting swimmers directly with the marine environment that historically defined the city but was long inaccessible due to industrial harbor activities. Safety features include defined swimming areas, lifeguard supervision during operating hours, and careful water quality monitoring. The project represents a broader Scandinavian trend of reclaiming urban waterways for recreational purposes following environmental cleanup efforts, with similar harbor baths in Copenhagen and other coastal cities.

The walkway's walls consist of glass panels in every color of the visible spectrum arranged in sequential rainbow order, creating an environment where visitors experience the city through continuously shifting colored light as they traverse the circle. This chromatic filtering transforms the familiar urban landscape into an extraordinary visual experience where buildings, harbor, forests and sky appear in perpetually changing hues depending on position, time of day, and weather conditions. Beyond its visual impact, the installation creates a contemplative space that encourages consideration of how perception shapes reality and how color influences emotional responses to environments.
