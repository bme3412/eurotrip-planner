  "overview_paragraph": "Strasbourg is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces buzz around Place Kléber and the Grande Île, the Gothic cathedral glows with seasonal light, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—including the famous Strasbourg Music Festival—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is magical and cozy—think Christmas markets in the Grande Île, local Alsatian restaurant stops, and twinkling holiday lights around the ancient half-timbered houses—while March begins to warm with the odd Alsatian shower and blooming trees around the historic squares.",
