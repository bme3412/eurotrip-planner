  "overview_paragraph": "Lille is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces hum around the Grand Place and Vieux-Lille, the Citadel Park blooms with seasonal flowers, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days at Palais des Beaux-Arts, local patisserie stops, and twinkling holiday lights—while March begins to warm with the odd shower and blooming trees around the historic squares.",
