This magnificent Gothic masterpiece houses the Shrine of the Three Kings, believed to contain the remains of the Three Wise Men, making it one of Christianity's most important pilgrimage sites. Standing 157 meters tall with its iconic twin spires dominating Cologne's skyline, the cathedral miraculously survived WWII bombing that destroyed much of the surrounding city. Its 7,000 square meters of stained glass windows, including the contemporary window designed by Gerhard Richter in 2007, create a breathtaking kaleidoscope of light within the vast interior that can accommodate more than 20,000 people.",
