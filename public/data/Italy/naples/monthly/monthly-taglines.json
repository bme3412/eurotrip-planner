  "overview_paragraph": "Naples is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when pleasant temperatures make exploring the historic center ideal, the archaeological sites are perfect for visits without crowds, and the coastal promenades come alive with fresh sea breezes. July brings warm evenings perfect for coastal walks along Posillipo and outdoor pizza dining—though some areas can be crowded; August offers a more relaxed atmosphere with fewer crowds. Winter (November–February) is mild and atmospheric—ideal for museum visits, exploring the covered markets, and enjoying the city's famous Neapolitan cuisine in warm trattorias—while March begins to warm with spring blossoms and the return of vibrant street life to the Centro Storico.",
