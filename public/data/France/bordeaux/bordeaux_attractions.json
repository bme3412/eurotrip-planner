The square's masterpiece is the Miroir d'Eau (Water Mirror), the world's largest reflecting pool at 3,450 square meters, creating stunning mirror images of the surrounding architecture that have become Bordeaux's signature image. The square features the Hôtel des Fermes (Customs House) where wine merchants paid taxes, and Hôtel de la Bourse (Stock Exchange) where wine futures were traded, both adorned with elaborate sculptures and Corinthian columns.
