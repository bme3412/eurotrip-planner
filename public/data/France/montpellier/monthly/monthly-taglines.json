  "overview_paragraph": "Montpellier is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces hum around Place de la Comédie and Écusson quarter, the Mediterranean landscape blooms with seasonal flowers, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close.
