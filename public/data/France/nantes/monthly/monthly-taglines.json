  "overview_paragraph": "Nantes is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces buzz around Place Royale and the medieval quarter, the Loire River sparkles with seasonal light, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days at Château des Ducs de Bretagne, local crêperie stops, and twinkling holiday lights—while March begins to warm with the odd shower and blooming trees around the historic Breton squares.",
