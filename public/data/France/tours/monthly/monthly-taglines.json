  "overview_paragraph": "Tours is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces buzz around Place Plumereau and the historic center, the medieval half-timbered architecture glows with seasonal light, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—including the famous Tours Summer Festival—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is mild and cozy—think holiday markets around Place Plumereau, local Loire Valley restaurant stops, and twinkling lights around the ancient medieval buildings—while March begins to warm with the odd spring shower and blooming trees around the historic squares.",
