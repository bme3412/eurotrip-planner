  "overview_paragraph": "Bordeaux is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when the historic streets of the Golden Triangle are alive with visitors, outdoor cafés line the Place de la Bourse, and the Grand Théâtre glows in golden light. July brings warm summer days perfect for wine tastings in the Médoc and exploring the city's elegant architecture—though it can be crowded with tourists. August offers quieter exploration of the historic center while some locals are away. Winter (November–February) reveals the city's cozy wine bar charm with fewer tourists—perfect for intimate wine tastings, warm southwestern cuisine, and peaceful walks along the Garonne. March welcomes spring with blooming chestnut trees and the first outdoor terraces reopening along the quays.",
