  "overview_paragraph": "Nîmes is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces buzz around Place de la Maison Carrée and the old town, the Roman monuments sparkle with seasonal light, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—including the famous Feria de Nîmes—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days at the Musée de la Romanité, local Mediterranean restaurant stops, and twinkling holiday lights around the ancient Arena—while March begins to warm with the odd Mediterranean shower and blooming trees around the historic Roman squares.",
