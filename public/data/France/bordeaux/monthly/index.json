July brings warm summer days perfect for wine tastings in the Médoc and exploring the city's elegant architecture—though it can be crowded with tourists. August offers quieter exploration of the historic center while some locals are away. Winter (November–February) reveals the city's cozy wine bar charm with fewer tourists—perfect for intimate wine tastings, warm southwestern cuisine, and peaceful walks along the Garonne. March welcomes spring with blooming chestnut trees and the first outdoor terraces reopening along the quays.","city":"Bordeaux","country":"France","last_updated":"2025-01-27","categories":[{"id":"must-do","title":"Must Do","description":"Essential Bordeaux experiences that define the city—iconic, memorable, and easy to recommend.","items":[{"id":"place-de-la-bourse-miroir","activity":"Visit Place de la Bourse & Miroir d'Eau","description":"Experience Bordeaux's most iconic landmark with the world's largest reflecting pool, creating stunning mirror images of the 18th-century architecture.","image":"/images/optimized/bordeaux-place-bourse-miroir.jpeg","optimal_time":"Sunset, March-October for water features","cost":"Free","duration":"1–2 hours","neighborhood":"Historic Center","tags":["Historic","Iconic","Outdoor","Photography"],"season":"year-round","isFree":true,"rating":null,"rating_count":0,"coordinates":[44.8418,-0.5695]},{"id":"cite-du-vin-experience","activity":"Explore La Cité du Vin","description":"World's premier wine museum with interactive exhibits, panoramic views from the Belvedere, and wine tasting experiences.","image":"/images/optimized/bordeaux-cite-du-vin.jpeg","optimal_time":"Morning, Tuesday-Thursday for fewer crowds","cost":"€22","duration":"3 hours","neighborhood":"Bassins à Flot","tags":["Museum","Wine","Indoor","Interactive"],"season":"year-round","isFree":false,"rating":null,"rating_count":0,"coordinates":[44.8597,-0.5526]},{"id":"cathedrale-saint-andre","activity":"Visit Cathédrale Saint-André","description":"UNESCO World Heritage Gothic cathedral with medieval frescoes, 18th-century organ, and separate Tour Pey-Berland bell tower.","image":"/images/optimized/bordeaux-cathedral.jpeg","optimal_time":"Morning before 10 AM","cost":"Free (tower €8)","duration":"1.5 hours","neighborhood":"Historic Center","tags":["Historic","Religious","Indoor","UNESCO"],"season":"year-round","isFree":true,"rating":null,"rating_count":0,"coordinates":[44.8377,-0.5771]},{"id":"rue-sainte-catherine-stroll","activity":"Stroll Rue Sainte-Catherine","description":"Europe's longest pedestrian shopping street with historic architecture, local boutiques, and authentic Bordelais atmosphere.","image":"/images/optimized/bordeaux-rue-sainte-catherine.jpeg","optimal_time":"Afternoon, Sunday for market experience","cost":"Free","duration":"2–3 hours","neighborhood":"Historic Center","tags":["Shopping","Historic","Outdoor","Local Life"],"season":"year-round","isFree":true,"rating":null,"rating_count":0,"coordinates":[44.8412,-0.5734]}]},{"id":"best-in-summer","title":"Best in Summer","description":"Prime months: June–August.
