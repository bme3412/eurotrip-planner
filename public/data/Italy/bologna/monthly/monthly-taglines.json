  "overview_paragraph": "Bologna is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when university students return to enliven the historic center, porticoes provide perfect shelter for exploration, and the culinary scene buzzes with fresh seasonal ingredients. July brings warm evenings perfect for dining in piazzas and cultural festivals—though some university areas quiet down; August offers a more relaxed atmosphere with fewer crowds.
