      "description": "Housed in a charming wooden Art Nouveau building from 1907, this unique museum presents Finnish wildlife through a series of detailed dioramas depicting natural landscapes from across the country. Twenty-four habitat recreations showcase animals and plants in their natural environments, from southern coastal regions to northern Lapland. The dioramas, created between 1907-1935, are considered historical works of art in themselves and offer a nostalgic glimpse into museum display techniques of the early 20th century.",
