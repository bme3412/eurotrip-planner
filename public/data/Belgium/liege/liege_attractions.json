The flowing, organic design with its rhythmic white arches eliminates the traditional barrier between city and station, making the boundary between interior and exterior space intentionally ambiguous. Beyond its aesthetic achievements, the station serves as a crucial high-speed rail junction connecting Liège to European destinations including Paris, Cologne, Brussels, and Frankfurt. The dramatic architecture has made Guillemins both a functional transportation facility and a tourist destination in itself, with visitors coming specifically to photograph and experience the structure. The station's construction catalyzed urban renewal in the surrounding district, with new developments including office buildings, hotels, and the renovation of public spaces extending the architectural impact beyond the station itself."
