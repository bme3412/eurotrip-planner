  "overview_paragraph": "Reims is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces buzz around Place Drouet d'Erlon and the old town, the cathedral sparkles with seasonal light, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—including the famous Champagne Festival—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days at the Palais du Tau, local French restaurant stops, and twinkling holiday lights around the ancient cathedral—while March begins to warm with the odd northern shower and blooming trees around the historic Gothic squares.",
