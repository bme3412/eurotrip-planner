  "overview_paragraph": "Florence is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when pleasant temperatures make exploring the historic center ideal, Renaissance gardens bloom with spring flowers, and the cultural scene buzzes with fresh seasonal exhibitions. July brings warm evenings perfect for dining in piazzas and cultural festivals—though some areas can be crowded; August offers a more relaxed atmosphere with fewer crowds.
