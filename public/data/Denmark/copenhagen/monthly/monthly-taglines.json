  "overview_paragraph": "Copenhagen is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces hum around Nyhavn and Strøget, the Kings Garden blooms with seasonal flowers, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days at the National Museum, local bakeri stops, and twinkling holiday lights at Tivoli—while March begins to warm with the odd shower and blooming trees around the historic squares.",
