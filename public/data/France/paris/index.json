    "brief_description": "Two thousand years of history unfold along the Seine—from Gothic cathedrals to Haussmann boulevards, hidden courtyards to world-class museums. Paris is where painters found light, writers found voice, and every traveler finds something unforgettable. Mornings begin with flaky croissants and café crème at zinc-topped bars; afternoons drift between masterpiece-filled galleries and sun-dappled Luxembourg chairs; evenings crescendo with Seine-side strolls as the Eiffel Tower sparkles on the hour. This is a city that rewards both the iconic bucket list and the aimless wander—where ducking down a cobblestone lane might reveal a century-old fromagerie, a jazz cellar, or a pocket garden tucked behind wrought-iron gates.",
