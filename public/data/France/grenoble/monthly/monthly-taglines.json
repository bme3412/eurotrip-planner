  "overview_paragraph": "Grenoble is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when café terraces hum around Place Grenette, alpine landscapes bloom with wildflowers, and touring weather is ideal. July brings long evenings and vibrant festivals—but also peak crowds and higher prices; in August some boutiques and smaller restaurants close. Winter (November–February) is quieter and cozy—think museum days, local patisserie stops, and twinkling holiday lights—while March begins to warm with the odd shower and blooming trees around the historic gardens.",
