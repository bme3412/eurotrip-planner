  "overview_paragraph": "Milan is at its best in spring (April–June) and early fall (September–October), when pleasant temperatures make exploring the historic center ideal, the fashion district buzzes with fresh seasonal collections, and the cultural scene comes alive with new exhibitions. July brings warm evenings perfect for aperitivo in Navigli and outdoor dining—though some areas can be crowded; August offers a more relaxed atmosphere with fewer crowds. Winter (November–February) is cozy and atmospheric—ideal for museum visits, shopping in the covered Galleria, and enjoying the city's famous Lombard cuisine in warm restaurants—while March begins to warm with spring blossoms and the return of vibrant cultural life to the historic center.",
