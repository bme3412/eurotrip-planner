The park's creation marked a significant transition from military to civilian use, transforming defensive fortifications into public recreation space during a period of urban expansion. The undulating landscape featuring mature specimen trees, ornamental water features, and winding paths exemplifies 19th-century romantic garden design principles.

Construction began in the early 15th century, replacing an earlier Romanesque church, but financial constraints prevented the tower from reaching its planned 134-meter height, leaving it truncated at 24 meters and earning it the affectionate local nickname 'stump tower.' Despite this unfinished element, the church showcases exceptional late Gothic architecture with elegant flying buttresses, an impressive central nave rising to 27 meters, and remarkable stained glass windows. The interior houses significant artistic treasures including Anthony Van Dyck's 'Crucifixion' altarpiece (1629), impressive baroque confessionals, and an ornate pulpit by Laurent Delvaux.

The elegant complex consists of two symmetrical pavilions connected by a central triumphal arch, all executed in a refined late 18th-century style with Doric columns, decorative friezes, and classical proportions that reflect the Enlightenment's preference for rational, harmonious design. Appropriately for its original function, the structure features numerous decorative elements inspired by marine themes, including Neptune sculptures, fish motifs, and water symbolism. Throughout its operational history until 1952, the marketplace served as the central distribution point for fish arriving from the North Sea coast, playing a vital role in Ghent's food supply system. After years of neglect following its closure as a market, the building underwent comprehensive restoration in the early 2000s, now housing restaurants and event spaces while maintaining its architectural integrity.
