      "description": "The Arab Baths of Caballel represent one of the few remaining Islamic bathhouse complexes in Toledo, dating from the 10th century when public bathing was central to Muslim social and religious life. Rediscovered during contemporary construction works, these partially restored baths feature the traditional three-chamber system of hammams: cold, warm, and hot rooms with characteristic star-shaped skylights in the vaulted ceilings. Although modest in size compared to other Islamic monuments, the baths provide valuable insight into daily life during Muslim Toledo, demonstrating sophisticated engineering for water management and heating systems while highlighting the importance of purification rituals in Islamic culture.",
